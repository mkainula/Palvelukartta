Palvelukartta
=============

Palvelukartta is a prototype iOS application for a school assignment.

It fetches nearby services from Helsinki City Service Map API (http://www.hel.fi/palvelukarttaws/rest/ver2_en.html) and shows them on a map.

Feature ideas:

* Filter results based on user selected search/category
* Combine with HSL Reittiopas API to show how to get there via public transport
* A cloud service which would store more details about places (ratings, comments, likes, etc.) and serve them through a simple RESTful API
